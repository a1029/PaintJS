        <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
            is an information system where documents and other web resources
            are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
            which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
            [1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
            may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
            and are published by a software application called a web server.
            The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
            which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
